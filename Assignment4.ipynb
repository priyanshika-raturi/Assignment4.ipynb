        "\n",
        "**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm (style of coding) that organizes software design around **objects**, rather than functions and logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "An **object** represents a real-world entity — like a student, car, or bank account — and combines **data (attributes)** and **behaviors (methods)** into a single unit.\n",

        "---\n",
        "Key Concepts of OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Class**\n",
        "   A class is a **blueprint** or **template** for creating objects.\n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Car:\n",
        "       def __init__(self, brand, model):\n",
        "           self.brand = brand\n",
        "           self.model = model\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Object**\n",
        "   An object is an **instance** of a class.\n",
        "   Example:\n",

        "4. **Abstraction**\n",
        "   Showing only the **essential features** of an object while hiding unnecessary details.\n",

        "5. **Inheritance**\n",
        "   Allows a class to **inherit** properties and methods from another class, promoting **code reuse**.\n",
